# Insurance-Management-Platform-with-Spring-Boot-and-Java

Assignment: Create an Insurance Management Platform with Spring Boot and Java
Objective: Build an insurance management platform that allows users to manage insurance
policies, clients, and claims using Spring Boot and Java.
Requirements:
1. Set up a new Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) and
select the necessary dependencies (e.g., Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and an
embedded database like H2 or Apache Derby).
2. Create the necessary domain models and their relationships:
a. Client: Represents a client with properties such as name, date of birth, address,
and contact information.
b. InsurancePolicy: Represents an insurance policy with properties like policy
number, type, coverage amount, premium, start date, and end date. Each policy
should be associated with a client.
c. Claim: Represents an insurance claim with properties like claim number,
description, claim date, and claim status. Each claim should be associated with
an insurance policy.
3. Implement RESTful APIs for the following actions:
a. Clients:
i. GET /api/clients: Fetch all clients.
ii. GET /api/clients/{id}: Fetch a specific client by ID.
iii. POST /api/clients: Create a new client.
iv. PUT /api/clients/{id}: Update a client's information.
v. DELETE /api/clients/{id}: Delete a client.
b. Insurance Policies:
i. GET /api/policies: Fetch all insurance policies.
ii. GET /api/policies/{id}: Fetch a specific insurance policy by ID.
iii. POST /api/policies: Create a new insurance policy.
iv. PUT /api/policies/{id}: Update an insurance policy.
v. DELETE /api/policies/{id}: Delete an insurance policy.
c. Claims:
i. GET /api/claims: Fetch all claims.
ii. GET /api/claims/{id}: Fetch a specific claim by ID.
iii. POST /api/claims: Create a new claim.
iv. PUT /api/claims/{id}: Update a claim's information.
v. DELETE /api/claims/{id}: Delete a claim.
4. Use Spring Data JPA to create repositories for the domain models and interact with the
embedded database or mysql
5. Implement exception handling and validation to ensure proper API usage and data
integrity.
6. (Optional) Write unit tests for the APIs and services using JUnit and Mockito (or any
other preferred testing framework).
7. (Optional) Add basic authentication or JWT-based authentication to secure the APIs.
Deliverables:
1. A GitHub repository containing the source code for the insurance management platform.
2. A README file that explains how to run the application locally and includes a brief
description of the project, its structure, and its features.
Thanks

Date used in this project : 

java.text.DateFormat
DateFormat is an abstract class for date/time formatting subclasses which formats and parses dates or time in a language-independent manner. The date/time formatting subclass, such as SimpleDateFormat, allows for formatting (i.e., date → text), parsing (text → date), and normalization. The date is represented as a Date object or as the milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.

DateFormat provides many class methods for obtaining default date/time formatters based on the default or a given locale and a number of formatting styles. The formatting styles include FULL, LONG, MEDIUM, and SHORT. More detail and examples of using these styles are provided in the method descriptions.

DateFormat helps you to format and parse dates for any locale. Your code can be completely independent of the locale conventions for months, days of the week, or even the calendar format: lunar vs. solar.

To format a date for the current Locale, use one of the static factory methods:

myString = DateFormat.getDateInstance().format(myDate);
If you are formatting multiple dates, it is more efficient to get the format and use it multiple times so that the system doesn't have to fetch the information about the local language and country conventions multiple times.

DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance();
 for (int i = 0; i < myDate.length; ++i) {
     output.println(df.format(myDate[i]) + "; ");
 }
To format a date for a different Locale, specify it in the call to getDateInstance().

DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG, Locale.FRANCE);
If the specified locale contains "ca" (calendar), "rg" (region override), and/or "tz" (timezone) Unicode extensions, the calendar, the country and/or the time zone for formatting are overridden. If both "ca" and "rg" are specified, the calendar from the "ca" extension supersedes the implicit one from the "rg" extension.

You can use a DateFormat to parse also.

myDate = df.parse(myString);
Use getDateInstance to get the normal date format for that country. There are other static factory methods available. Use getTimeInstance to get the time format for that country. Use getDateTimeInstance to get a date and time format. You can pass in different options to these factory methods to control the length of the result; from SHORT to MEDIUM to LONG to FULL. The exact result depends on the locale, but generally:

SHORT is completely numeric, such as 12.13.52 or 3:30pm
MEDIUM is longer, such as Jan 12, 1952
LONG is longer, such as January 12, 1952 or 3:30:32pm
FULL is pretty completely specified, such as Tuesday, April 12, 1952 AD or 3:30:42pm PST.
You can also set the time zone on the format if you wish. If you want even more control over the format or parsing, (or want to give your users more control), you can try casting the DateFormat you get from the factory methods to a SimpleDateFormat. This will work for the majority of countries; just remember to put it in a try block in case you encounter an unusual one.

You can also use forms of the parse and format methods with ParsePosition and FieldPosition to allow you to

progressively parse through pieces of a string.
align any particular field, or find out where it is for selection on the screen.
Synchronization
Date formats are not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread. If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized externally.

API Note:

Consider using DateTimeFormatter as an immutable and thread-safe alternative.

Implementation Requirements:

The format(Date, StringBuffer, FieldPosition) and parse(String, ParsePosition) methods may throw NullPointerException, if any of their parameter is null. The subclass may provide its own implementation and specification about NullPointerException.
The setCalendar(Calendar), setNumberFormat(NumberFormat) and setTimeZone(TimeZone) methods do not throw NullPointerException when their parameter is null, but any subsequent operations on the same instance may throw NullPointerException.
The getCalendar(), getNumberFormat() and getTimeZone() methods may return null, if the respective values of this instance is set to null through the corresponding setter methods. For Example: getTimeZone() may return null, if the TimeZone value of this instance is set as setTimeZone(null).
